# 🧠 C# Examination System (Console App)

This is a simple **Console-based Examination System** built using **C#**.  
The main goal of this project is to demonstrate strong understanding and practical application of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts.

## 🎯 Purpose of the Project

This project was developed as a learning exercise to:

- Apply core **OOP principles** using C#
- Build a modular and reusable system using **classes, interfaces, and inheritance**
- Handle user input/output in a console environment
- Simulate real-world logic for exams, students, instructors, and questions
